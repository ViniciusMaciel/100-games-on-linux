name: Deus Ex
notes: '- Using GMDX mod: GMDX is an award-winning large-scale modification for the
  2000 PC classic Deus Ex. GMDX addresses the many flaws of the game, polishes it
  to a very high standard, and adds new layers of depth that one would have hoped
  to see in a sequel. GMDX is executed with the strict parameter of staying true to
  the original design principles that define Deus Ex, and seeks to improve all aspects
  of design excluding the plot and soundtrack. The cumulative result thus far is said
  to be, and aims to be the "definitive Deus Ex experience".'
